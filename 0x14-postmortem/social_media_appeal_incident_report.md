# Social Media Campaign Incident Report

##   Issue Summary
At 12:50 PM PDT on August 8, 2017, Twitter user Elaine Yeung ([@egsy](https://twitter.com/egsy)) launched a tweet campaign targeting [Slack](https://slack.com/). The goal of the campaign was to apply social pressure on Slack so that they would make an exception to their [Slack for Education](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/206646877-Slack-for-Education) screening process and recognize [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/) as an educational organization. The parent tweet was retweeted 6 times and received 14 likes. Within three hours, Slack responded and held firm to their existing policy. The goal of receiving an education discount was not achieved, rendering the tweet campaign a failure.


## Timeline

#### Definitions

According to [Twitter's documentation](https://business.twitter.com/en/help/campaign-measurement-and-analytics/tweet-activity-dashboard.html), every tweet generates a number of analytic points. The three points of analysis referenced in the below report are:

- Impressions: Times people were served a Tweet in timeline or search results
- Engagements: Total number of times someone interacted with a Tweet. Clicks anywhere on the Tweet, including Retweets, replies, follows, likes, links, cards, hashtags, embedded media, username, profile photo, or Tweet expansion
- Engagement rate: The number of engagements divided by the number of impressions


Tweets (all times listed in PDT) | Impressions | Engagements | Engagement rate

### Issue detection and actions taken

- **2015-2016** - Elaine oversaw her the adoption of Slack at her previous organization and is a self-proclaimed super-fan of the service.
- **November 2016 - ongoing** - Elaine enrolled at Holberton School. After several months of observing Slack usage at school, she identified ways in which students at the school could optimize their usage of the service
  - **March 1, 2017** - for her first stand-up talk, Elaine chose to highlight ways in which classmates could better use Slack. During stand-up she learned that Slack did not recognize Holberton School as an educational institution.
  
### Level of incident escalation

- August 8, 2017 - Elaine messaged #all_hippokampoiers channel on slack asking them to retweet and like her original tweet

### Incident resolution

- Slack's response to Elaine resolved the incident.
- 

##  Root cause and resolution

### explain in detail what was causing the issue

With each new batch of students enrolled, the number of users on the Holberton School Slack team is ever increasing. Holberton School is currently using a free account. Free accounts are limited to a 10,000 message limit. With more members sending more messages, messages are quickly lost. One of Slack's hallmark functions is its ability to search message archives. At the school's current rate of slack usage, 10,000 messages are sent within a three week period, rendering all messages older than that unsearchable. 

### explain in detail how the issue was fixed

The root issue is still unresolved and Holberton School's slack team is still limited to 10,000 message limit.

##   Corrective and preventative measures

Moving forward, 
- improved/fixed
- a list of tasks to address the issue (example: patch Nginx server, add monitoring on server memory...)

# EXTRA NOTES
The root issue is still unresolved and Holberton School's slack team is still limited to 10,000 message limit.
