##   Issue Summary

At 12:50 PM PDT on August 8, 2017, Twitter user [@egsy](https://twitter.com/egsy) launched a tweet campaign targeting [Slack](https://slack.com/). The goal of the campaign was to apply social pressure on Slack so that they would make an exception to their [Slack for Education](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/206646877-Slack-for-Education) screening process and recognize [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/) as an educational organization. The parent tweet was retweeted 6 times and received 14 likes. Within three hours, Slack responded and held firm to their existing policy. The goal of receiving an education discount was not achieved, rendering the tweet campaign a failure.

##   Timeline (format bullet point, format: `time` - `keep it short, 1 or 2 sentences`) must contain:

- when was the issue detected
- how was the issue detected (monitoring alert, an engineer noticed something, a customer complained...)
- actions taken (what parts of the system were investigated, what were the assumption on the root cause of the issue)
- misleading investigation/debugging paths that were taken
- which team/individuals was the incident escalated to
- how the incident was resolved
